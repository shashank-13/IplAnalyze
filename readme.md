                         Overview 

                The application displays the analysis of the players from IPL in graphical format.The projects main purpose is to find how batsman scoring rate changes as they approach their innings.Similarly for bowlers in which period of the innings they pick most of their wickets.Finally for fielders ,who are the live-wires in the fields and are the best of the fielders from the rest.



             			Why 

             	As I am always passionate about sports from the beginning I wanted to analyze the strategies of different players and who are more effective in which period of the innings .


          				Brief Details


          		The mini-project is divided into two main modules :

          		1.Extracting and structuring the data: The data of each match of IPL was available .So I maintained records for each teams separately.While analyzing data of a particular match I kept track of the top players in each department of a team and updated the data as it changed.Finally the top ten batsman,bowlers and fielders of each team was sorted out and kept separately in a new file.

          		All of this involved handling file I/O in python and playing around with numpy arrays and lists.


          		2.Displaying Data in Android : So after copying all the files in assets folder I made use of the open source library Androidplot to display data in line-graph and histogram format.
